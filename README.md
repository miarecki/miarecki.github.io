- **Bachelor's Thesis: "Elliptic Curves"**  
  University of Wrocław, 2024  
  - *Abstract*: The aim of this thesis is to present selected topics related to elliptic curves in an elementary manner. The thesis includes certain results on the $j$-invariants of Edwards elliptic curves: in particular, the computation of the sum of $j$-invariants and the sum of distinct $j$-invariants of these curves over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ depending on $p$ modulo $8$. These theorems are new results. Additionally, in an elementary way, a formula will be derived for the number of distinct $j$-invariants of Edwards elliptic curves over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ depending on $p$ modulo $24$.
