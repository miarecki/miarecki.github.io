- J. Miarecki *Sum of distinct j-Invariants of Edwards Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields* 
  University of Wrocław, 2024  
  - *Abstract*: Let $p \ge 5$ be prime and $\mathbb{F}_p$ be a finite field. We denote by $\mathcal{J}_p$ a set of all possible distinct $j$-invariants of Edwards elliptic curve over a field $\mathbb{F}_p$. In this paper we will show that
$$
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}_p} j =
\begin{cases}
    396 \mod p & \text{if } p \equiv 3 \pmod{8},\\
    424 \mod p & \text{if } p \equiv 1,5 \pmod{8},\\
    -468 \mod p & \text{if } p \equiv 7 \pmod{8}.
\end{cases}
$$
This paper is based on a chapter from my bachelor's thesis \cite{Miarecki2024}, originally written in Polish.
**This paper was awarded a distinction in the PTM Józef Marcinkiewicz competition for the best student paper in mathematics in 2024.**

### Thesis

- **Bachelor's Thesis: "Elliptic Curves"**  
  University of Wrocław, 2024  
  - *Abstract*: The aim of this thesis is to present selected topics related to elliptic curves in an elementary manner. The thesis includes certain results on the j-invariants of Edwards elliptic curves: in particular, the computation of the sum of j-invariants and the sum of distinct j-invariants of these curves over a finite field F<sub>p</sub> depending on p modulo 8. These theorems are new results. Additionally, in an elementary way, a formula will be derived for the number of distinct j-invariants of Edwards elliptic curves over a finite field F<sub>p</sub> depending on p modulo 24.

- **Master's Thesis: "TBD"**  
  University of Opole, 2026
  - *Abstract*: TBD
